# Function Contracts

A function contract is a formal Gospel specification attached to the declaration
of an OCaml function in an interface. Here is an example:

```ocaml
val euclidean_division: int -> int -> int * int
(*@ q, r = euclidean_division x y
    requires y.v > 0
    ensures  x.v = q.v * y.v + r.v
    ensures  0 <= r.v < y.v *)
```

A function contract is composed of two parts:
 - The first line is the **header** of the contract; it names the function
   arguments and results and must appear at the beginning of the contract.
 - The next lines contain as many specification clauses as needed. The
   previous example features three clauses: one precondition introduced by
   `requires` and two postconditions introduced by `ensures`.

```ebnf title="Function contract syntax"
contract = header? clause*
header = (identifier_tuple "=")? identifier parameter+
clause = "requires" formula
       | "checks" formula
       | "ensures" formula
       | "raises" exception_case ("|" exception-case)*
       | "modifies" expr ("," expr)*
       | "equivalent" string_literal
       | "diverges"
       | "pure"
       | "consumes" expr ("," expr)*
exception_case = qualid "->" formula
               | qualid pattern "->" formula
               | qualid
identifier_tuple = identifier ("," identifier)*
parameter = "()" | identifier | "~" identifier | "?" identifier
```

:::tip

Even if the order of clauses is not imposed by the grammar, we suggest to use
the following systematic order for uniformity:

- `requires` preconditions,
- `checks` preconditions,
- `modifies` and `consumes` effects,
- `ensures` postconditions,
- `raises` exceptional postconditions.

:::

##  Default Behaviour

To avoid boilerplate for usual properties, Gospel applies a default contract
whenever a function has a specification attached. Of course, any
explicitly declared clause overrides this implicit contract.

When a function has a contract attached, the default contract contains the
following properties:
- The function **terminates**.
- The function **does not raise any exception** other than `Stack_overflow` or
  `Out_of_memory`.
- The function **does not have any visible side-effect on the memory**. In other
  words, if it mutates some data, this has no observable influence on the values
  in the rest of the program.

:::caution

   In the absence of a contract attached to a function declaration, you cannot
   make any assumptions about its behaviour: the function may diverge, raise
   unlisted exceptions, or modify mutable states. However, **it still cannot
   break any type invariant.**

   You can still enable the default implicit properties about exceptions, mutability,
   non-termination, etc., by creating an empty contract:

   ```ocaml
   val euclidean_division: int -> int -> int * int
   (*@ q, r = euclidean_division x y *)
   ```

:::

## Preconditions

Preconditions are **properties that must hold at the function entry**. You can use
them to describe requirements on the function's inputs, but you can also possibly use them on a
global state that exists outside of the function arguments.

You can express preconditions using the keyword `requires` or `checks` followed by a
formula.

### `requires`

A `requires` clause states under which conditions a specified function has a
well-specified behaviour.

Whenever a `requires` precondition is violated, its behaviour becomes
unspecified, and the call should be considered faulty. Even if the function
execution terminates, any other information provided by the contract
(postconditions, exceptions, effects, ...) cannot be assumed.

For example, the following function requires `y` to be positive to behave correctly.

```ocaml {3}
val eucl_division: int -> int -> int * int
(*@ q, r = eucl_division x y
    requires y.v > 0
    ensures  x.v = q.v * y.v + r.v
    ensures  0 <= r.v < y.v *)
```

### `checks`

Preconditions introduced with `checks` hold at function entry. However, unlike
`requires` clauses, the behaviour of the function is well-specified in case the
prestate doesn't meet such a precondition. The function fails by raising an
OCaml `Invalid_argument` exception and doesn't modify any existing state. The
call is not faulty, but the caller is now in charge of handling the exception.

For example, if we change the function contract of `eucl_division`
above by replacing `requires` with `checks`, it now states that the
function raises `Invalid_argument` whenever `y <= 0`.

:::note Combining multiple pre-conditions


Whenever multiple preconditions of the same kind coexist, they hold as a
conjunction, which means

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    requires P
    requires Q *)
```
is equivalent to:

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    requires P /\ Q *)
```

When combining `checks` and `requires` preconditions, the declaration order
doesn't matter. The `requires` clauses take precedence and must always be
respected; otherwise, the `checks` behaviour cannot be assumed. This means that
ultimately,

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    requires P
    checks Q *)
```
is equivalent to:

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    requires P
    checks P -> Q *)
```
:::

:::tip

Specification formulas can often be written using few clauses, but splitting the
specification into several smaller clauses leads to better readability and
maintainability and is therefore encouraged.

:::


## Postconditions

Postconditions are **properties that hold at the function exit**. They are used
to specify how the function's outputs relate to its inputs and how the call
mutated the memory.

:::caution

  **When a function raises an exception, its postconditions are not expected to
  hold.** You must use exceptional postconditions instead.

:::

Gospel introduces postconditions using the keyword `ensures` followed by a
formula.

As discussed in the previous section, the property expressed by the formula is
verified after the function call only if the preconditions were satisfied.

:::note Combining multiple postconditions

The handling of multiple postconditions is identical to preconditions of the
same kind. Multiple postconditions are merged as a conjunction:

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    ensures P
    ensures Q *)
```

is equivalent to:

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    ensures P /\ Q *)
```

:::

## Exceptional Postconditions

Exceptional postconditions are used to specify the exceptions that can be
raised by the function and what postconditions hold in those cases.

By default, functions should not raise any exceptions, and doing so is a
violation of the specification. Whenever a function can raise an exception as
part of its expected behaviour, this exception must be listed along with the
associated postconditions.
:::info

Some exceptions are implicitly allowed and do not have to be listed because
they could be unexpectedly triggered, depending on the specifics of the machine
the code is executed on.

**The implicitly allowed exceptions are `Stack_overflow` and `Out_of_memory`.**

This is equivalent to adding a `raises Out_of_memory | Stack_overflow -> true`
clause to every function contract. Of course, you can still override that
behaviour by stating a property whenever these exceptions are raised, like any
other exception:

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    raises Stack_overflow -> false *)
```

:::

Exceptional clauses are expressed using a `raises` keyword, followed by a list
of cases associating each exception with its formula. Those clauses use a syntax similar to
pattern-matching.

Gospel expects each `raises` clause to perform an exhaustive pattern-matching
for each exception constructor listed in this clause. Similar to OCaml's
pattern-matching, when an exception is raised, the postcondition that's
satisfied is the first match in the list of cases.

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    raises Unix_error (ENAMETOOLONG, _, _) -> P
         | Unix_error _                    -> Q *)
```

The previous contract (notice that it's an exhaustive pattern-matching on
the `Unix_error` exception) only states that `P` holds whenever `Unix_error` is
raised with argument `ENAMETOOLONG`, and `Q` holds whenever the function
raises `Unix_error` with a different argument. (`P` doesn't necessarily hold in
this case.)

:::note Combining multiple exceptional post-conditions

When multiple exceptional postconditions exist, they hold independently of
each other, meaning that the raised exception is matched against each `raises`'s
case list, and each matching post-condition must hold in conjunction. For
instance, the contract:

```ocaml invalidSyntax
(*@ ...
    raises Error "foo" -> P | Error _ -> Q
    raises Error x -> R *)
```

implies that
 - when `Error "foo"` is raised, both `P` and `R` hold, but not necessarily `Q`;
 - when `Error` is raised with with an argument different from `"foo"`, both `Q`
   and `R` hold, but not necessarily `P`.

:::


## Code Equivalence

Complementary to other specification clauses, Gospel allows you to talk about
*code equivalence* in the function contract. Put it in a string containing
the OCaml code that behaves like the function, preceded by the `equivalent` keyword.

This is useful when specifying functions whose behaviour can hardly be expressed
in pure logic:

<!-- This code extract is invalid because functions returning unit must modify
     something, equivalent is not enough -->
```ocaml invalidSyntax
type 'a t
val iter : ('a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit
(*@ iter f t
    ...
    equivalent "List.iter f (to_list t)" *)
```

With such a specification, no logical assertion is provided, but applying `iter`
to `f` and `t` is equivalent to applying `List.iter` to `f` and the conversion
of `t` to a list. This doesn't leak implementation details, as `iter` might in
fact be implemented in a different, more efficient way. It does however make the
specification concise and elegant.


:::danger

At the moment, the Gospel type-checker does **not** type-check the code provided
inside the `equivalent` clauses and will take it as-is.

:::

## Non-Termination

By default, OCaml functions with an attached contract implicitly terminate.

If a function is allowed to not terminate (e.g., a server main loop, a function
waiting for a signal or event, etc.), one can add this information to the
contract using the `diverges` keyword.

The following example states that the execution of the function `run` may not
terminate. It doesn't specify whether this function is always non-terminating
or not.

<!-- invalidSyntax: see #317 -->
```ocaml invalidSyntax
val run : unit -> unit
(*@ run ()
    diverges
    (* ... *) *)
```

## Data Mutability

In the default specification, functions don't mutate any observable data. If
your function mutates an argument or some global state, you may specify it using
the keyword `modifies`, followed by an identifier. In the following, the
`contents` model of `a` can be modified by `inplace_map`.

```ocaml {3}
type 'a t
(*@ mutable model contents: int *)

val inplace_map : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a t -> unit
(*@ inplace_map f a
    modifies a.contents *)
```

If the function only modifies a few models of a value, these may be explicitly
added to the clause.

If a specific model is not mentioned, the whole data structure and its mutable
models are potentially mutated.

```ocaml {3}
val inplace_map : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a t -> unit
(*@ inplace_map f a
    modifies a *)
```

In this example, all the mutable models of `a` can be mutated by `inplace_map`.

:::note

When a `modifies` clause is present, it affects all the declared postconditions
and exceptional postconditions, meaning that the function may mutate data even
in the case of exceptional postconditions.

If your data was not mutated in an exceptional poststate, for instance if the
function raised an exception **instead** of mutating the data, you have to
manually specify it:

```ocaml {4}
exception E
val inplace_map : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a t -> unit
(*@ inplace_map f a
    modifies a.contents
    raises E -> a.contents = old (a.contents) *)
```

:::

## Pure Functions

An OCaml function can be declared as `pure`, which means it
- has no side effect;
- raises no exception;
- terminates.

```ocaml {2}
val length : 'a t -> int
(*@ pure *)
```

Pure functions can be used in further Gospel specifications.
On the contrary, OCaml functions not declared as `pure` cannot be used
in specifications.

## Data Consumption

Gospel provides a specific syntax to specify that some data has been consumed by
the function, and should be considered dirty (that is, not used anymore) in
the rest of the program. This is expressed with the `consumes`
keyword:

```ocaml invalidSyntax
val destructive_transfer: 'a t -> 'a t -> unit
(*@ destructive_transfer src dst
    consumes src
    ... *)
```


## Ghost Parameters

Functions can take or return ghost values to ease the writing of function
contracts. Such values appear within brackets in the contract header.

Consider the following `log2` function:

```ocaml
val log2: int -> int
(*@ r = log2 [i: integer] x
    requires i >= 0
    requires x.v = pow 2 i
    ensures r.v = i *)
```

In this contract, the ghost parameter `i` is used in both the preconditions and
postconditions. By introducing it as a ghost value, we avoid using quantifiers
to state the existence of `i`.

:::note

Since the type of ghost parameters does not appear in the OCaml signature, it
must be given explicitly.
