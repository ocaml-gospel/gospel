(** Vectors (aka resizable arrays, growing arrays, dynamic arrays, etc.)

    This module implements arrays that automatically expand as necessary. Its
    implementation uses a traditional array and replaces it with a larger array
    when needed (and elements are copied from the old array to the new one). The
    current implementation doubles the capacity when growing the array (and
    shrinks it whenever the number of elements comes to one fourth of the
    capacity).

    The unused part of the internal array is filled with a dummy value, which is
    user-provided at creation time (and referred to below as ``the dummy
    value''). Consequently, vectors do not retain pointers to values that are
    not used anymore after a shrinking.

    Vectors provide an efficient implementation of stacks, with a better
    locality of reference than list-based implementations (such as standard
    library {!Stack}). A stack interface is provided, similar to that of
    {!Stack} (though {!Vector.push} have arguments in the other way round).
    Inserting [n] elements with {!Vector.push} has overall complexity O(n) i.e.
    each insertion has amortized constant time complexity. *)
