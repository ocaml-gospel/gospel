# Tell git to stop considering generated `dune.inc` files as source
# files that can be diffed so that it will:
#
# - skip that noise in diffs, logs, etc.
# - leave the content of those files untouched when there is a merge
#   conflict, as conflict markers prevent `dune` from interpreting
#   those files, for instance to run `dune runtest --auto-promote`
#   that would fix them...

dune.inc -diff
