(** [mk_op_apply op arg1 arg2] Creates a term for the application of the
    operator [op] to the list of arguments [args]. Although this function could
    be used for any function application, the locations of the subterms would
    not correspond to what would be expected. *)

(** If [t] is an application of an infix operation using the [Tinfix]
    constructor, then [chain t] desugars it so that it uses the [Tidapp]
    constructor. If [t] is a chain of infix operators (e.g. 3 < 4 <= 5 > ...)
    then [infix t] desugars it into a conjuction of [Tidapp] constructors so
    that the term represents [3 < 4 /\ 4 <= 5 /\ 5 > ...]. If [t] is not a chain
    of infix operators, then this function returns [t] unchanged.

    This function is useful for typechecking since it normalizes infix
    operations into using the same constructor as normal function applications,
    but also necessary during parsing to mark the end of a chain of infix
    operators. For example: without this function [3 < (4 < 5)] would be
    represented the same way as [3 < 4 < 5]. To avoid this, we use this function
    to end the chain [Infix] constructors. *)
