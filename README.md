## About

Gospel is a behavioural specification language for OCaml program. It provides
developers with a non-invasive and easy-to-use syntax to annotate their module
interfaces with formal contracts that describe type invariants, mutability,
function pre-conditions and post-conditions, effects, exceptions, and [much
more](https://ocaml-gospel.github.io/gospel/)!

```ocaml
type 'a t
(*@ model capacity : integer
    mutable model contents : 'a sequence
    with s
    invariant s.capacity > 0
    invariant Sequence.length s.contents <= s.capacity *)

exception Full
exception Empty

val create : int -> 'a t
(*@ s = create n
    requires n.v > 0
    ensures s.capacity = n.v
    ensures s.contents = Sequence.empty *)

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
(*@ b = is_empty s
    pure
    ensures b <-> s.contents = Sequence.empty *)

val clear : 'a t -> unit
(*@ clear s
    modifies s.contents
    ensures s.contents = Sequence.empty *)

val push : 'a -> 'a t -> unit
(*@ push a s
    modifies s.contents
    ensures s.contents = Sequence.cons a (old s.contents)
    raises Full -> Sequence.length (old s.contents) = s.capacity
                /\ s.contents = old s.contents *)

val pop : 'a t -> 'a
(*@ a = pop s
    modifies s.contents
    ensures a = Sequence.hd (old s.contents)
    ensures s.contents = Sequence.tl (old s.contents)
    raises Empty -> old s.contents = Sequence.empty = s.contents *)

val pop_opt : 'a t -> 'a option
(*@ o = pop_opt s
    modifies s.contents
    ensures match o with
                | None -> old s.contents = Sequence.empty = s.contents
                | Some a -> old s.contents = Sequence.cons a s.contents *)

val top : 'a t -> 'a
(*@ a = top s
    ensures a = Sequence.hd s.contents
    raises Empty -> s.contents = Sequence.empty *)
```

We designed Gospel to provide a tool-agnostic frontend for bringing formal
methods into the OCaml ecosystem, meaning that we make no assumptions on the
future use of the specifications.

You can use Gospel specifications to complete and precise your documentation
comments with non-ambiguous annotations and use a type-checker to ensure they
always remain in sync. Other tools also rely on these annotations to provide
additional features such as automated deductive verification or runtime
assertion checking.

Gospel!

## Getting Started

### Installation

Gospel is available on Opam repositories. Installing it is straightforward:

```shell
$ opam install gospel
```

This will install the `gospel` tool binary, as well as the developer library if you
wish to build your software on top of Gospel. You may check the installation with:

```shell
$ gospel --version
gospel version 0.2.0
```

### Usage

Gospel contracts live in OCaml interface files (`.mli`), as special comments
starting with the `@` symbol:

```ocaml
type 'a array
(*@ mutable model contents : 'a sequence *)

val max_array: int array -> int
(*@ m = max_array a
    requires Sequence.length a.contents > 0
    ensures forall i. 0 <= i < Sequence.length a.contents -> (a.contents[i]).v <= m.v
    ensures exists i. 0 <= i < Sequence.length a.contents /\ a.contents[i] = m *)
```

Gospel provides a type-checker that ensures that your specifications are
well-formed, well-typed, and remain in sync with the interface they annotate!

```shell
$ gospel check max_array.mli
```

Gospel also provides a ppx rewriter to allow odoc to display the contents of
gospel specifications and declarations as documentation. This ppx rewriter
works under the assumption that the source preprocessor has been run first. The
dune stanza reads as follows:

```dune
(library
 (name lib_name)
 (preprocess
  (pps gospel.ppx -- -pp "gospel pps")))
```

Be aware that it is the user's responsability to run the gospel type-checker when needed.

### Tools using Gospel

> You are using Gospel as a frontend? [Let us
> know!](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/gospel/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell)

At the moment, three tools leverage Gospel specifications to provide more
guarantees to your programs:

- **[Cameleer](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/cameleer).** A tool that extends
  Gospel to implementation files to provide semi-automated deductive
  verification of OCaml programs.
- **[Ortac](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/ortac).** A testing tool for OCaml
  programs that converts the Gospel specifications into code to test that they
  hold at runtime. You may use it to generate testing suites and fuzzers or
  monitor your program execution.
- **[Why3gospel](https://github.com/ocaml-gospel/why3gospel).** A Why3 plugin that
  lets you verify that a program proof refines the Gospel specifications before
  extracting it to OCaml.
